# SecureSMX

Release notes (DOC\smx540.txt) have information about boards supported and
configuration. We recommend using STMicro STM32F746G-Discovery (Cortex-M7)
which is commonly available for about $50 (e.g. DigiKey STM32F746G-DISCO).

Manuals are in DOC\Manuals. The SecureSMX manual supplements the SMX manuals.

IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm v9.40.2 or later is required. We mainly work
with this version currently, but we also tested quickly with v9.70.1.

See license.txt and welcome.txt.

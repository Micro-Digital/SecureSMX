smx v6.0.0
----------

This file documents the version of smx and tools supported by this
release. Using a slightly newer version of the tools is often ok,
but generally you cannot use an older one since project files will
not backward convert and settings will be broken when opened in an
older version of the IDE.


ARM IAR Embedded Workbench (IAR.AM, IAR.ARM):
   EWARM         v8.1x-v8.5x, v9.1x-v9.7x


Please see the section for your compiler in the SMX Target Guide
for the most up to date tool installation information.

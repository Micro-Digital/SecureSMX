Installation
------------

The files here should be copied into the appropriate directory in
your debugger or compiler suite, according to the directions in the
smxAware User's Guide Installation section for your tools.

Keep in mind that the smxAware files you have may support only the
version of your tools that your SMX release supports. If you have a
problem with new tools, ask if we have a newer version available.

See the Troubleshooting section in the smxAware User's Guide if you
have any problems getting smxAware working.
